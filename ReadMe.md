Cluster-Cluster Aggregation Overview
------------------------------------
Cluster-Cluster Aggregation is a good model for the behavior of aerosol particles. This full-stack application will include alternate cluster development discovery. This means that one will be able to make a change in the history of the cluster development to see how things could have gone if a single change was made.

Program Overview
----------------
1) Seed a grid with a given number of "particles" in random positions
2) Choose a random particle and move it in a random direction (Up, Down, Left or Right)
3) If a particle come into contact with another particle it will stick to the other particle and the two particles will then move as a cluster.
4) This behavior continues until only one cluster remains
5) This full-stack app will also keep track of the movement history, allowing a user to retrace the development of the clusters in the program.
